HD44780 LCD connected to PCF8574 I2C

This paper presents a library for Arduino that allows interfacing a 16x2 LCD display with the HD44780 controller via the PCF8574 I2C expander. The library provides basic functions for displaying text and controlling the backlight on the LCD. The library is based on two previous works by Batutay (2023, 2024) that implemented libraries for the HD44780 and the PCF8574 separately. The paper demonstrates some examples and explains the advantages of using I2C communication over parallel wiring. The paper also describes how to install the library on the Arduino 2 IDE following the instructions by Batutay (2023).
